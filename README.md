Bion Tracers

Interactive Cyberpunk Fiction

Swirl (Okraglak, abandoned, expanded) Crowd control connected with an agency opposing Wikileaks-type of organization (known as a Leak). Intrigue surrounding the activities of trying to bring down the Leaks.

QR codes. Dokos, layer of delusion in Greek.

Treeform swerved against the dark backdrop of the cube. Delicate invisible winds pushed the glowing branches, flickers of emitted light bouncing and rebounding off the matt walls of the room.

As he reached out for the nano-console activator, Orphan finally spoke. He could hear her clearly despite the constant cacophony of air vents blasting through.

"Light of the masses - information will burn you."

Pressing a small plate on his temple he jumped. Swirls of morphing walls enveloped him twisting his perspective, confusing his vision. Disoriented in non-physical space he grasped for stability but there was nothing out there. The void surrounded him already.

"It's an endless agenda, unstable structure of avoidance glorifying the march of the flames. Don't try to break the high pitch - it will fry your consciousness, go for the low tones and stay safe."

High pitch was the channel of information overload where everything was visible. If you had the right eyes for it that is. Operating it required a shielded gaze and a strong psychological resistance. Otherwise he would end up just like Orhpan told him.

He thought on the gaze and focused. As he was given the coordinates before, he sensed the channel right before him. Streamlined glow filling his head with sudden speed and urgency. It was painful.

"You are a fool Vincent" Orphan said. "Go for the low and stay safe."

"There is a difference between trying to grab something for yourself and trying to conquer it first and subdue it. I'm going for the flames. The low just doesn't cut it"

Muting Orphan's comm, he dived into the glow to embrace it.

Biosynthetic tree, fluorescent - growing in the dark. A boy has it in his room. He received it in a seed he finds on the street by accident (an escape, a chase, dropping of the seed and the container). Crowded city, fast family.Boy ventures out on a journey that will bring his fluorescent tree back to life.In a world filled with biotechnology and human enhancement, where boundaries no longer exist, no nations, just districts.Music in a club creates resonance, kind of a brain feedback drug experienced through sound - the binaural music in a fleshed out, ready for the mainstream masses, form.

Seed container.
